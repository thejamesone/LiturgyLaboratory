## Privacy policy

This document outlines the practices we've put in place to respect the privacy, and thus the personhood, of our visitors. Here we explain what data we gather about our visitors, how we use it, and how visitors can control what happens to it. We carefully consider our code to make sure it meets these privacy standards. However, if you would prefer to do your own audit, you can't find the source code for this website [here](https://github.com/thejamesone/LiturgyLaboratory)

### Web analytics

We use basic web analytics to record the following: 
- the number of visits per page
- the website they came from (if a visitor comes via another website eg. after making a Google search, or following a link on a blog) 
- the kind of device (eg. iPhone, laptop)
- the operating system (eg. Windows, OSX)
- the internet browser (eg. Chrome, Internet Explorer)
- the language of the device
- the dimensions of the screen
- the general geographical location of the device (eg. United Kingdom, Ireland, United States)[^1]

At no point is this data capable of being traced to a specific individual visitor. All activity on LiturgyLaboratory.com is anonymous. 

We do not us any tracking cookies, or other cross-site tracking technologies. 

This information helps us understand what server capacity we need, what browsers we need to support, what screen sizes we need to design for. This helps us design and sustain this website with the minimum environmental impact. This information also helps us understand what content resonates with out audiences. 

We use a privacy focused, open source software called Counter to gather this information. Read more about counter [here](https://counter.dev/), or audit it's code [on GitHub](https://github.com/ihucos/counter.dev)

[^1]:We encourage visitors to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) if they would like to obscure their general location. A VPN works by routing your internet traffic through a secure server in another country, so that it appears that your device is there instead. We recommend [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/), because it's free and a trusted name in internet privacy.

### Privacy regulations

We are committed to complying with GDPR, CCPA, PECR and other privacy regulations on our website. 

### Email correspondence

If you choose to contact us via our email, we will keep a record of the correspondence and email address so that we can respond to your email. 

We do not share this information with third parties. We do not send unsolicited emails. 

Visitors can request that we delete this information permanently by emailing [privacy@liturgylaboratory.com](mailto:privacy@liturgylaboratorty.com).

### Data expiry

Inspired by biblical concept of the year of jubilee, we practice data expiry every 49 weeks (7x7 weeks). Email correspondences older than 49 weeks old are automatically deleted. Email addresses associated with these correspondences are also deleted, unless they are part of more recent correspondences. 

### Contact us

Contact us at [privacy@liturgylaboratory.com](mailto:privacy@liturgylaboratorty.com) if you have any questions or special inquiries.
