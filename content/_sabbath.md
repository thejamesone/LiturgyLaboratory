# Sabbath Shalom

Thanks for visiting liturgylaboratory.com.

Inspired by the practice of Sabbath in Hebrew scripture, we believe in setting one day a week aside from work to rest and reflect. The Sabbath is not merely a rest from work because our biology requires it. It is an opportunity to remember God's first and on-going act of creation; time. In doing so, the Sabbath shows us the overarching narrative of God's creation. The Sabbath is truly a ‘day that stops’. It is a holy inconvenience to our best-laid plans forcing us to re-evaluate our efforts in terms of God’s work.

liturgylaboratory.com will return tomorrow. In the meantime go outside, call someone you love, practice a new hobby, and celebrate God's holy gift of time.

> "The meaning of the Sabbath is to celebrate time rather than space. Six days a week we live under the tyranny of things of space; on the Sabbath we try to become attuned to holiness in time. It is a day in which we are called upon to share in what is eternal in time, to turn from the results of creation to the mystery of creation; from the world of creation to the creation of the world"[^1]
