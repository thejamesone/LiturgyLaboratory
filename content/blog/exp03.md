### Hashtag, pray for me.  

One of the benefits of the internet is its ability to connect you with the lives of people far away. Prayer is a way of speaking blessing into these distant situations. Every day we search Twitter for posts that contain the words "pray for", and we circulate them in an email.

These prayer requests are direct quotes from Twitter. You may disagree with the premise of the prayer request or find it offensive. Still, we encourage you to find something about the person or situation worth praying for.

But praying for distant strangers should not distract you from needs in your community. Use these prayer prompts to speak blessing into distant needs. But also to allow those needs to make you more aware of similar needs close to home. Someone tweets a prayer for their sports team to win. Who in your life needs a win right now?

We recommend following these three steps. We include them in each day's email, in case you forget.

1. Pick a prayer prompt and pray for the person or situation it mentions. Please respect the person's space, and refrain from reaching out to them.

2. Pray for someone in your life that this prayer prompt makes you think of. Contact them to encourage them if appropriate.

3. Pray for a personal need that this prayer prompt makes you think of. Contact someone you trust for support if you need it.
