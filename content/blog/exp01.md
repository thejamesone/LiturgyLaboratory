## Can a website be loving?

What does it mean to design with love? Love can be a vague and slippery concept. A person can say they love their spouse and also say they love Thai food; the meaning of the word love is very vulnerable to it's context. The kind of love discussed here is what philosophical theologian Nicholas Wolterstroff calls care-love. Wolterstroff argues that this is the kind of love that Jesus had in mind when he said "Love your neighbour as yourself", found in the books of Matthew and Mark in the Bible. To love your neighbour is to seek their good, secure their rights, and respect their worth for no other reason than the fact that they are your neighbour [^1]. And everyone is your neighbour.

## So, how might we apply the principles of love to a website?

Liturgylaboratory.com has been designed with the principles of care-love in mind. Although it might at first glance look like any other website, it operates a little differently. Here we will step through all the design decisions that were made with love in mind.

### Loving the environment is also loving your neighbours

The internet is an energy hungry creature. According to some estimates the internet, and its supporting systems, account for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions. That is similar to the amount produced by the global airline industry [^2].

Inspired by The Low Impact Manifesto from Organic Basics [^3], this website has taken some steps to reduce its carbon footprint.

**This website does not use large images or videos.**
You may have noticed a little animation of a flame on the home page. This is what's known as a css sprite animation. With this method we can reduce the size of the animation to 3kb, compared to ~99kb if it were a video.

**This website minimises the power consumption on the users device.**
By reducing our data usage the users computer has to work less hard to load the website. We also don't do any processing heavy tasks, like rendering 3D graphics, or detailed user tracking.

**This website limits the amount of light emitted by the screen.**
The colour scheme was chosen to maximise contrast, while reducing the light emitted by the screen and thus power consumption.

**This website does not use any custom fonts.**
The font we use is Trebuchet MS. It's generally considered 'web-safe' as it comes preinstalled on all modern computers. This means we don't have to load a custom font from our server in order to display our website.

**This website uses 100% renewable electricity.**
This website is hosted with Green Geeks [^4] which power their servers with renewable energy. They do this by purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) which link the electricity they use to renewable energy sources. They purchase enough RECs to match the energy they consume as well as 2 other companies their size.

### Respecting the users data is loving your neighbour.

We believe that a user's data is precious, and to take it without permission is akin to robbery. Organisations that extract large amounts of personal user data to fuel their advertising economies do not properly respect the worth of the user.

This website collects no personal data. We only record anonymous, aggregated data, such as the number of visitors we get, and the types of device they use. We do not use any cookies or other tracking technologies to follow visitors around.

### Taking a day off is loving your neighbour.

Inspired by the practice of Sabbath in Hebrew scripture, we believe in setting one day a week aside from work to rest and reflect. The Sabbath is not merely a rest from work because our biology requires it. It is an opportunity to remember God's first and on-going act of creation; time. In doing so, the Sabbath shows us the overarching narrative of God's creation.

This website demonstrates this day of rest by becoming inactive for one day every week. If you were to visit liturgylaboratory.com on a Saturday, instead of the usual website, you will see a message explaining that this website is inactive during the Sabbath. In doing so we hope to encourage visitors to step away from their screens and enjoy God's gift of the Sabbath.

### Accessibility is loving your neighbour.

Web accessibility is the practice of making a website useable by anyone regardless of ability. Often, flashy web technologies can act as unnecessary barriers to people who rely on assistive technologies.

This website has been designed to comply with accessibility guidelines. Users who rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies should be able to navigate without difficulty. However, if you experiences any accessibility issues, please let us know by emailing [hello@liturgylaboratory.com](mailto:hello@liturgylaboratory.com).
