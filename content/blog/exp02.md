## Data, data everywhere.  
As you use the internet, your web browser accumulates data. These data keep you logged into websites, enables personalisation, and supports targeted advertising. These data enable the always-on, always selling, always watching economy of the internet. It's not that all these purposes are evil. It's just that sometimes you, and your data, need a break.

Data liturgy is a short liturgy that guides you in prayerfully deleting your browsing data. This includes browsing history, cookies, and cache. Liturgy Laboratory has developed this data liturgy plugin to help you take a brief step back. Take a deep breath, reflect on the internet. How have you used it? How has it used you? Allow yourself to be reminded that you are more than what you can produce, more than the sum of your data, more than the numbers of likes on your last post. Allow grace to extend into your data, letting that record of your internet use go. Allow this grace to heal you and guide you in more loving internet use.

We recommend using this plugin once a week as part of a weekly tech sabbath. Pick a day, maybe Saturday. The night before, take a minute to clear all the accumulated data of the week. Spend the next day outside, or with friends, or practising a new hobby. Reflect on what it means to be part of a global network like the internet and how you might use it to its full potential for love.
